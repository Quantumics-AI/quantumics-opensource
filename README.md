# About Quantumics

Velocity, variety, veracity, and volume of data have exploded over the years. The use of the data has been broadly consistent for the top line or bottom line improvement and compliance. But the complexity of data and operational costs have skyrocketed because of high licence cost for different tools, integration and hard dependence on IT and scarce data resources such as System admins, Data Engineers, and Data Scientists to clean and engineering data.

Every product idea starts with a personal struggle with something. Quantumics.AI founder, Shen Pandi, having worked in the data industry and consulting firms for a decade, found no single SaaS solution in the market to extract value from data with self-servicing capability (ingest, cleanse, engineer, automate, govern with storytelling capability). The need to solve this problem became pressing after working with various clients in different industries who had the same problem; hence there was a desperate need for a better solution.

# Prerequisites.
## Deploy Quantumics.AI required cloud resources 
By using our [cloudformation temlate](https://github.com/Quantumics-AI/quantumics/blob/main/configurations/AWS_CFT_EMR_QSAI.yaml), you can easly deploy all the required AWS service and configurations on your AWS account. Please read the description in the [cloudformation temlate](https://github.com/Quantumics-AI/quantumics/blob/main/configurations/AWS_CFT_EMR_QSAI.yaml) to make yourself aware that what are all the services and configuration are deployed. Below is a highlevel services which will be deployed by the template.
```text
1. IAM programatic user with AccessKey and SecreatAccesskey and roles
2. Five numbers of s3 buckets.
3. EMR cluster on EC2 which lunches three EC2 instaces Primery, Core and Task
4. EC2 Machine prefere t3.larg with atlease 30 GB diskspace
5. Secrity Grpous configuration 
    - EMR-Master Security group : open below port on 0.0.0.0/0.
        - 8080 To allowing trafic from Quantumics gateway service 
        - 8998 To allowing trafic from EMR Livy traffic  
        - 18080 To allowing trafic from EMR Spark traffic
    - EC2-Security group : open below port on 0.0.0.0/0.
        - 7000 To allowing trafic from Quantumics backend service 
        - 8080 To allowing trafic from Quantumics backend service 
        - 8081 To allowing trafic from Quantumics backend service 
        - 8082 To allowing trafic from Quantumics backend service 
        - 8083 To allowing trafic from Quantumics backend service 
        - 5000 To allowing trafic from Quantumics backend service 
```

### Setting up EMR with python modules
Once the Quantumics.AI [cloudformation temlate](https://github.com/Quantumics-AI/quantumics/blob/main/configurations/AWS_CFT_EMR_QSAI.yaml) is created sucsufully you need to login to the primery EMR instace by using SSM and run the script [install-python-modules-emr.sh](https://github.com/Quantumics-AI/quantumics/blob/main/configurations/install-python-modules-emr.sh) to install required python modules. 

# Quick Start
You can run Quantumics.AI locally with Docker.

## Cloning repo and creating Environment file
1. Cloning Quantumics.AI repository and creating .env file
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Quantumics-AI/quantumics.git
# Change directory to quantumics directory 
cd quantumics
# Create .env file and provide above said information
touch .env
```
2. Edit .env file in the root directory that you created and copy the information in bash format as below. Replace required values. Replace the local host with public IP of your EC2 instace. Do not chage the ports. Copy the Livy url from EMR console of your AWS account. Copy the AccessKey ans SecreateAccessKey from AWS secreates of your accunt. Copy the S3 bucketNames. All this information is avialble in the CLoudformation console. 
```bash
API_URL=http://localhost:8080
DASHBOARD_URL=http://localhost:5000
SERVICE_HOST_URL= http://localhost:8080/
# EMR livy end point
LIVY_URL=${YOUR-LIVY-URLHERE}
# AWS Access keys and Secreate access keys
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=${YOUR-AccessKeysHere}
AWS_SECRET_KEY=${YOUR-SecreateAccessKeysHere}
AWS_REGION=${YOUR-DefaultRegionHere}
# You need create 7 number of s3 bucket frist and then provide the s3 bucket name as below.
S3_IMAGES_PROJECT_BUCKET={PIUIBucktnameCreatedFromCFT}/Project-Images 
S3_IMAGES_USER_BUCKET={PIUIBucktnameCreatedFromCFT}/User-Images 
S3_UDF_BUCKET={UDFBucketNameCreatedFrom CFT} 
S3_ATHENA_QUERY_LOCATION=s3://{AthenaBucketNAmeCreatedFromCFT}/data/ 
S3_CLEANSING_ETL_LOCATION=s3://{ETLBucketNameCreatedFromCFT}/ 
S3_ENG_ETL_LOCATION=s3://{ETLBucketNameCreatedFromCFT}/eng/ 
S3_ENG_RESULT_LOCATION=s3://{ResulutsBucketNameCreatedFromCFT}
PROJECT_NAME={YOUR_USERNAME}-workspace{SOME_RANDOM_STRING}
```
## Initial Setup
